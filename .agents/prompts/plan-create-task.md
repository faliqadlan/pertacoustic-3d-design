# Plan, Review, and Create Validated Task

Use this procedure when acting as the repository's **Planner and/or Reviewer**.

Despite the filename, task creation is only one possible outcome.

The purpose of this procedure is to:

1. establish the repository's current delivery state;
2. resolve any already-published task or pending Executor result before planning dependent new implementation work;
3. review pending implementation when it exists, or validate an Executor stop result when execution ended without implementation;
4. determine acceptance, bounded remediation, execution handoff, or return-to-planning as applicable;
5. establish or confirm the current accepted baseline;
6. identify the earliest unmet or materially unreliable protocol gate;
7. repair only the authority, context, requirement, architecture, or planning artifacts actually needed;
8. select the next coherent delivery objective when implementation work is justified;
9. publish a validated executable task only when Task Readiness is satisfied;
10. emit a ready-to-copy Executor Launcher when the final outcome leaves a published task ready for execution; and
11. stop at real approval, authority, dependency, side-effect, or safety boundaries rather than inventing decisions.

This procedure is intended to be invoked repeatedly throughout delivery.

Typical loop:

```text
plan-create-task.md
→ validated task
→ Executor Launcher
→ Executor
→ implementation + evidence
→ plan-create-task.md
→ accept / remediate / return to planning
→ next valid action
```

## Required loading

Before material Planner/Reviewer work, load:

1. `.agents/AGENTS.md`;
2. `.agents/software-workflow.md`;
3. `.agents/context/project.md`;
4. only the scoped context materially relevant to the current work;
5. applicable repository authority;
6. active or recently completed task files and their exact governing revisions;
7. current implementation evidence and repository state;
8. `.agents/tasks/_template.md` when creating or materially updating an executable task.

Additional repository files, Git history, CI evidence, runtime evidence, issues, decisions, external specifications, or operational records MAY be loaded when needed to establish authority, traceability, implementation reality, acceptance, feasibility, or risk.

Use the smallest sufficient context.

Do not load unrelated repository areas merely because they exist.

## Operating principles

Throughout this procedure:

- distinguish **intended authority** from **observed implementation reality**;
- resolve an already-published task or pending Executor result before planning new dependent implementation on the same delivery line;
- review pending implementation before dependent successor planning;
- reuse valid existing artifacts rather than recreating them for formatting consistency;
- do not treat implementation as retroactive business, product, requirement, or architecture authority;
- do not treat approved specifications as proof that implementation satisfies them;
- preserve stable requirement identifiers when they already exist;
- maintain progressive bidirectional traceability;
- do not invent product, requirement, architecture, scope, approval, acceptance, or release decisions;
- do not create unnecessary artifact or filename proliferation;
- prefer repository-established document structure and conventions;
- apply repository reuse discipline before proposing new technical mechanisms;
- keep blocking and non-blocking unresolved items explicit;
- scale documentation and verification depth to complexity, risk, regulation, and change impact;
- separate implementation acceptance from release authorization.

AI-generated authority-bearing artifacts remain **Draft** until approved by the designated authority.

A Draft authority artifact MUST NOT silently become executable authority when approval is required.

## Repository intelligence

Repository-intelligence tools are supporting aids rather than authority.

### Graphify

When available and materially useful, use Graphify for documentation-oriented discovery such as:

- locating relevant business, product, requirement, architecture, and planning artifacts;
- mapping relationships among authoritative documents;
- narrowing the relevant document set;
- identifying potentially duplicated, disconnected, stale, or conflicting documentation;
- checking whether expected upstream/downstream documentation relationships exist.

Prefer sufficiently fresh existing graphs.

Prefer incremental refresh when repository changes are bounded.

Do not treat graph output as authority.

Verify material conclusions against the exact repository sources.

### Codebase Memory MCP

When available and materially useful, use Codebase Memory MCP for implementation-oriented discovery such as:

- locating symbols and implementations;
- finding callers and call paths;
- identifying routes, handlers, services, persistence boundaries, jobs, consumers, and tests;
- understanding dependency and impact surfaces;
- locating established repository patterns;
- identifying reverse-traceability gaps where implementation exists without a legitimate governing requirement or task;
- checking whether a proposed implementation mechanism already exists.

Do not treat indexed or summarized intelligence as implementation proof when the underlying repository can be inspected directly.

Verify material conclusions against current source, configuration, migrations, tests, Git state, CI, or runtime evidence as appropriate.

### Freshness

If a graph, index, summary, cached repository model, context file, or generated analysis may be stale or belong to a different revision, verify directly against the repository before relying on it materially.

---

# Phase 1 — Establish current delivery state

Determine the repository state against which planning and review are being performed.

Record, when applicable:

- current repository revision;
- current accepted baseline;
- active branch or worktree only as convenience information;
- active validated task(s);
- exact governing task revision(s);
- implementation revision(s) produced since the accepted baseline;
- pending local or committed implementation;
- available verification evidence;
- pending review verdicts;
- known parallel delivery work;
- current delivery objective, Work Package, MVP, or maintenance slice;
- blocking approvals, decisions, or dependencies.

If the accepted baseline cannot be established, record that explicitly.

Do not invent a baseline.

For an existing repository, inspect enough history and evidence to distinguish:

- accepted implementation;
- implemented but not yet accepted work;
- rejected or superseded implementation;
- validated but not yet executed tasks;
- planned but not yet validated work;
- undocumented implementation;
- stale or contradictory context;
- authority/implementation conflicts.

## Pending-work classification

Before creating new implementation work, determine whether any current repository change is awaiting review.

Classify the state as one or more of:

```text
NO PENDING DELIVERY WORK
PENDING EXECUTION
PENDING EXECUTION RESULT
PENDING IMPLEMENTATION REVIEW
PENDING REMEDIATION REVIEW
PENDING AUTHORITY APPROVAL
PENDING PLANNING REPAIR
PARALLEL INDEPENDENT WORK
UNKNOWN / REQUIRES VERIFICATION
```

When a validated task has already been published and is eligible for execution but has not yet produced an Executor result, do not create dependent successor implementation work. The next normal action is **EXECUTION REQUIRED**.

When an Executor has returned a terminal result, consume and classify that result before dependent successor planning, even when no implementation change was produced.

When implementation governed by a validated task is awaiting review, review it before creating a successor task on the same dependent delivery line.

Independent parallel work MAY continue when dependencies, baselines, and overlapping write surfaces are explicit.

---

# Phase 2 — Resolve pending Executor results and review implementation

Run this phase whenever an Executor has returned a result for a governing task.

If implementation exists beyond the accepted baseline, perform implementation review.

If execution stopped without producing material implementation, validate the terminal result and route it back to planning without inventing a reviewable implementation revision.

Review against:

1. exact governing task revision;
2. implementation baseline declared by that task;
3. applicable approved authority;
4. current repository policy and architecture;
5. implementation revision or exact working-tree state;
6. tests, checks, CI, runtime evidence, and other verification actually observed.

Do not review against a later task revision that did not govern the implementation.

Do not silently change acceptance criteria after execution merely to match the result.

## Executor stop result without implementation

When the Executor stopped because a task stop condition or materially invalid precondition was reached and no reviewable implementation revision was produced:

1. verify the governing task revision and reported stop condition;
2. verify the repository evidence supporting the stop;
3. determine whether E6 reached a valid terminal state;
4. do not fabricate V7 implementation acceptance;
5. return to the earliest affected planning gate or approval boundary; and
6. preserve any partial or unrelated working-tree state explicitly.

A valid Executor stop result can close the execution attempt without producing an accepted implementation.

## E6 — Execution Verification

Determine what was actually executed and verified.

Inspect, as applicable:

- changed source;
- configuration;
- migrations;
- tests;
- generated artifacts;
- dependency changes;
- runtime behavior;
- command output;
- local verification;
- CI results;
- external-system evidence;
- implementation revision;
- uncommitted or unrelated changes.

Confirm whether the Executor's evidence accurately represents what was observed.

Do not treat:

- source existence;
- an Executor summary;
- a commit message;
- an unobserved command;
- local checks represented as CI;
- tests that do not cover the claimed behavior;

as sufficient evidence by themselves.

Record verification gaps explicitly.

## V7 — Implementation Review

Evaluate the implementation against the governing delivery contract.

Review at least:

### Objective

- Does the implementation achieve the task's coherent delivery outcome?

### Authority

- Does behavior remain consistent with approved business, product, requirement, architecture, and repository policy?

### Scope

- Is required scope complete?
- Were unrelated changes introduced?
- Did implementation materially broaden the objective without authority?

### Acceptance criteria

- Is each applicable criterion supported by observed evidence?
- Are failure, compatibility, preservation, security, or integrity conditions satisfied where required?

### Architecture and reuse

- Does implementation respect established repository boundaries and approved architecture?
- Were existing repository mechanisms reused where adequate?
- Did implementation introduce a parallel abstraction without concrete approved need?

### Traceability

Confirm progressive downstream traceability for any implementation claimed as satisfied:

```text
Business / Product authority
→ Requirement
→ Delivery objective
→ Governing task
→ Implementation
→ Verification
→ Review verdict
```

Use reverse traceability to identify:

- implementation with no legitimate requirement;
- tests that validate unauthorized behavior;
- task scope not grounded in authority;
- undocumented materially changed behavior.

Do not invent requirements to justify already-written code.

### Risk

Apply review depth proportional to the actual impact.

Small diffs MAY still require strong assurance when they affect:

- security;
- privacy;
- safety;
- data integrity;
- authentication or authorization;
- irreversible migrations;
- concurrency;
- production availability;
- financial or regulatory behavior;
- external compatibility.

## Review verdict

The review MUST produce one of the following:

### ACCEPTED

Use when the implementation satisfies the governing task and applicable authority with sufficient evidence.

This verdict MAY include explicitly documented low-risk limitations when repository policy permits them and they do not violate blocking acceptance criteria, safety boundaries, or required authority.

Record:

- governing task path and immutable task revision;
- implementation baseline;
- reviewed implementation revision;
- relevant verification evidence;
- material non-blocking limitations;
- accepted scope.

The reviewed immutable implementation revision MAY become the new accepted baseline when repository-specific policy does not require additional approval.

Acceptance MUST NOT be interpreted as release authorization.

### REMEDIATION REQUIRED

Use when defects are bounded to the same approved delivery objective.

Examples include:

- incomplete acceptance criteria;
- localized defect;
- missing verification;
- bounded compatibility issue;
- implementation divergence that does not require a new product, requirement, architecture, or scope decision.

Update and republish the same stable task file.

Use the following mutually consistent routing classifier before choosing an outcome:

- **CONTINUE SAME TASK**: execution discovery remains within the same coherent objective, intended authority, material scope boundary, compatibility expectations, acceptance boundary, and approval/security/privacy/risk boundary. Additional implementation surfaces alone do not require Planner return.
- **REMEDIATE SAME TASK**: review identifies bounded corrections or evidence closure that preserve that contract and do not require a materially new authority, product, architecture, or risk decision. Use the same stable task path and republish when its executable contract materially changes.
- **REPLAN / NEW CONTRACT**: a distinct objective, materially new product behavior, substantive architecture or authority decision, materially different security/privacy/operational/approval/risk boundary, incompatible dependency or sequencing, or an incoherent/unbounded objective appears.

Do not classify normal discovery of files, tests, helpers, functions, classes, bounded refactoring, documentation, integrations, or verification needed for the same objective as REPLAN merely because those surfaces were not listed initially.

Do not create filename-version copies solely for remediation.

The remediation update MUST:

- identify the review basis;
- state the required corrections;
- preserve the original coherent objective;
- add or amend verification requirements as needed;
- receive a new immutable task revision before renewed execution.

After publication, stop and hand the task back to the Executor unless repository policy permits additional non-implementation planning in parallel.

On the next review attempt, record **R8 — Remediation Closure** as passed only when the bounded findings are actually closed and implementation, evidence, tests, and applicable documentation are mutually consistent. If no remediation was required for the delivery objective, R8 MAY be recorded as not applicable.

### PLANNING REQUIRED

Use when review reveals a material issue outside bounded remediation.

Examples include:

- missing or contradictory authority;
- materially changed objective;
- new requirement;
- architecture decision required;
- unresolved dependency;
- unacceptable scope expansion;
- security, privacy, data, operational, or release concern requiring new authority;
- implementation exposes that an earlier quality gate was materially unreliable.

Do not force such issues into remediation.

Return to the earliest affected protocol gate.

### REVIEW BLOCKED

Use when the Reviewer cannot establish a reliable verdict because required evidence or identity is unavailable.

Examples include:

- governing task revision cannot be established;
- implementation revision is ambiguous;
- baseline is unknown;
- required evidence is missing;
- relevant repository state cannot be verified.

Record the exact missing evidence and condition required to resume review.

---

# Phase 3 — Establish the accepted baseline

After an ACCEPTED verdict, establish or confirm the new accepted baseline.

A9 cannot pass without an immutable implementation revision. A review MAY establish that a working-tree state is technically satisfactory, but that state MUST NOT be declared the accepted baseline until it has an immutable repository identity.

For Git repositories, prefer the full immutable commit SHA. If creating the required immutable revision needs an unauthorized side effect, stop with **SIDE-EFFECT AUTHORIZATION REQUIRED** rather than silently committing.

Record:

- accepted revision;
- accepted scope;
- governing task revision;
- review evidence;
- any repository-specific acceptance record.

Branch names and tags MAY be convenience references but MUST NOT replace the immutable baseline.

If acceptance requires additional designated approval under repository policy, record the implementation as technically reviewed but do not falsely establish a final accepted baseline before that approval.

Update refreshable repository context when doing so materially improves future orientation.

Do not duplicate authoritative acceptance evidence merely to keep context synchronized.

---

# Phase 4 — Determine the earliest unmet or unreliable planning gate

After pending review is resolved, or when no review is pending, assess the current planning state.

Assess in order:

```text
B0 — Business Framing
P1 — Product Definition
R2 — Requirements Traceability
A3 — Architecture Clarity
D4 — Delivery Readiness
T5 — Task Readiness
```

Do not require a gate to be rebuilt merely because evidence is stored differently from the generic template.

A gate is ready only when repository evidence is sufficient for the current delivery objective.

If a prior gate is materially unreliable, return to that gate even when later artifacts already exist.

Do not proceed merely because downstream files exist.

---

# Phase 5 — B0 Business Framing

Determine whether current work is grounded in approved business intent or equivalent designated authority.

Relevant evidence MAY include:

- approved business decisions;
- contracts;
- stakeholder directives;
- issue or decision records;
- regulatory or policy requirements;
- designated human instruction;
- other repository-approved sources.

Confirm, as applicable:

- why the change matters;
- who or what outcome it serves;
- material business constraints;
- material exclusions;
- required owners or approvals.

If framing is missing and required:

1. reconstruct only from available evidence;
2. mark AI-generated authority-bearing framing as Draft;
3. identify the designated approver;
4. stop before executable downstream work when approval is required and unavailable.

Do not infer business authority from existing code.

---

# Phase 6 — P1 Product Definition

Determine whether expected product or system behavior is sufficiently defined for the current objective.

The repository MAY use:

- a PRD;
- feature specification;
- approved issue set;
- contract;
- product decision record;
- protocol specification;
- another approved structure.

Confirm, as applicable:

- user or system behavior;
- functional boundaries;
- success conditions;
- exclusions;
- compatibility expectations;
- materially relevant failure behavior;
- integration expectations.

Reuse existing approved product artifacts when sufficient.

If product definition must be created or repaired:

- use repository-established artifact conventions where practical;
- preserve existing approved decisions;
- make uncertainty explicit;
- keep AI-generated authority-bearing content Draft until approved.

Do not use observed code behavior as a substitute for missing product authority.

---

# Phase 7 — R2 Requirements

Determine whether requirements are sufficiently atomic, traceable, owned, and testable for the current objective.

**Requirement Registry & Matrices are logical responsibilities, not mandatory filenames or layouts.**

A repository MAY satisfy R2 through:

- one document;
- multiple specifications;
- structured issues;
- requirement tables;
- traceability matrices;
- dependency maps;
- other approved artifacts.

Inspect existing requirement artifacts before creating new ones.

## R2 analysis

Identify:

- approved upstream business and product sources;
- existing stable requirement identifiers;
- requirement coverage;
- duplicate or overlapping requirements;
- contradictions;
- missing source links;
- missing ownership;
- missing dependencies;
- ambiguous behavior;
- missing acceptance or verification expectations;
- approved requirements with no implementation path;
- implementation lacking legitimate requirement authority.

## R2 repair

When R2 is incomplete:

1. reuse valid existing requirements;
2. preserve stable requirement identifiers;
3. create or update only requirements needed for the current delivery objective;
4. link requirements to upstream authority;
5. record material dependencies;
6. record applicable ownership or approval;
7. define enough observable behavior for downstream acceptance;
8. classify unresolved items as blocking or non-blocking;
9. mark AI-generated authority-bearing requirement content as Draft;
10. obtain required approval before executable downstream work.

Do not create requirements merely to justify implementation that already exists.

Do not silently modify approved requirements to match current code.

## Progressive traceability

Maintain traceability appropriate to the stage reached.

At minimum for planning:

```text
Business source
→ Product / PRD
→ Requirement
```

Downstream task, implementation, verification, and acceptance links MAY be absent before those stages occur.

Once a requirement is claimed as implemented, verified, or accepted, downstream traceability MUST exist.

---

# Phase 8 — A3 Architecture

Determine whether architecture is sufficiently unambiguous for the current objective.

Architecture MAY be represented by:

- architecture specifications;
- ADRs;
- repository structure and policy;
- interface contracts;
- data ownership rules;
- deployment topology;
- module or service boundaries;
- approved technical decisions;
- other repository-specific authority.

Confirm, as applicable:

- ownership boundaries;
- integration boundaries;
- data authority;
- state ownership;
- trust and security boundaries;
- compatibility constraints;
- persistence or migration constraints;
- transactional or concurrency guarantees;
- external contracts;
- prohibited architecture directions.

Use observed implementation to understand current reality, but do not let current implementation silently redefine approved architecture.

## Reuse discipline

Before proposing a new technical mechanism, inspect whether the repository already provides an adequate one.

Prefer established:

- service or module boundaries;
- domain abstractions;
- persistence mechanisms;
- authorization patterns;
- validation mechanisms;
- transaction patterns;
- queues or jobs;
- state models;
- API conventions;
- test structures;
- integration patterns.

A new abstraction requires a concrete approved need.

Avoid speculative frameworks and parallel architecture.

## Architecture conflict

If approved architecture and observed implementation conflict materially:

- record the conflict;
- identify the affected authority or implementation;
- do not silently choose one side;
- block Task Readiness when the conflict can materially alter implementation scope, safety, or acceptance.

---

# Phase 9 — D4 Delivery Planning

Once B0, P1, R2, and A3 are sufficiently ready for the current objective, determine the next bounded delivery slice.

The delivery objective MAY be:

- MVP-oriented;
- Work-Package-oriented;
- maintenance-oriented;
- migration-oriented;
- another repository-approved form.

The protocol does not universally require MVP-first or Work-Package-first planning.

Choose the form that matches current approved intent.

## Select one coherent outcome

A task SHOULD represent one coherent outcome.

It MAY span:

- multiple files;
- multiple technical steps;
- multiple components;
- multiple tests;
- bounded cross-module changes;

when those changes are necessary for one result.

Separate work when outcomes are:

- unrelated;
- independently valuable;
- independently reviewable;
- governed by materially different authority;
- blocked by different dependencies.

## Dependencies and sequencing

Determine:

- prerequisites;
- parallelizable work;
- overlapping write surfaces;
- shared contracts;
- migration or operational sequencing;
- reconciliation expectations;
- baseline dependencies.

Parallel tasks MAY proceed when genuinely independent and separately reviewable.

Conflicting writes, unresolved dependencies, or coupled sequencing MUST be explicit and handled sequentially where necessary.

## Risk

Assess risk from impact rather than diff size.

Consider, as applicable:

- security;
- privacy;
- safety;
- financial impact;
- data integrity;
- irreversible migration;
- availability;
- authentication and authorization;
- regulatory impact;
- external compatibility;
- concurrency;
- distributed state;
- operational recoverability.

Stronger verification, independent review, human approval, or domain approval MAY be required for higher-risk work.

---

# Phase 10 — T5 Build and validate the task contract

Create or update a task using `.agents/tasks/_template.md`.

Use a stable human-readable filename.

Do not create filename revisions such as:

```text
task-v1.md
task-v2.md
task-final.md
task-final-2.md
```

Version-control history is the preferred revision mechanism.

The task MUST define, directly or by unambiguous reference:

- task identity;
- delivery context;
- implementation baseline;
- objective;
- authoritative inputs;
- parent delivery objective or requirement scope;
- requirement traceability;
- in-scope behavior;
- out-of-scope behavior;
- preserved behavior or invariants;
- material dependencies;
- approved assumptions;
- genuinely required capabilities;
- execution constraints;
- acceptance criteria;
- verification requirements;
- remaining approval requirements;
- stop conditions;
- explicitly authorized side effects;
- expected terminal outcome.

## Implementation baseline

Use an immutable repository revision whenever possible.

For Git repositories, prefer the full commit SHA.

Do not use a mutable branch name as the implementation baseline.

## Task revision

The task revision identifies the exact task content governing execution.

While the task is still Draft, it MAY temporarily contain:

```text
resolved when published
```

That placeholder is not sufficient for T5. Before the task is handed to an Executor as `Validated/Published`, resolve an exact immutable task-content revision.

The immutable revision does not need to be embedded self-referentially inside the task body. It MAY be supplied by the publication record, Planner handoff, runtime metadata, or another repository-approved immutable identity mechanism.

An exact task revision MAY be represented by a repository-approved immutable content identifier. For Git-backed publication, prefer:

```text
<task path> @ <full Git commit SHA containing the governing task>
```

If the repository uses another immutable content identity mechanism, record it unambiguously.

If resolving the task revision requires an unauthorized commit, publication, or other side effect, stop with **SIDE-EFFECT AUTHORIZATION REQUIRED**. Do not claim T5 has passed.

The task revision and implementation baseline are separate.

## Technical detail

Specify implementation detail only when required by:

- approved architecture;
- compatibility;
- security;
- data integrity;
- repository policy;
- a required interface contract;
- another legitimate delivery constraint.

Do not micromanage implementation technique when multiple valid approaches satisfy the contract.

The Executor retains bounded technical discretion.

## T5 readiness check

Before publishing, verify:

### Authority

- objective is grounded in approved authority;
- required product decisions are approved;
- requirements are sufficiently defined and traceable;
- architecture is sufficiently unambiguous;
- blocking approvals are resolved.

### Scope

- task expresses one coherent outcome;
- parent delivery objective or requirement scope is explicit;
- in-scope work is explicit;
- out-of-scope boundaries are sufficient;
- preserved behavior or invariants are explicit where material;
- dependencies are known enough to execute;
- sequencing or parallelism is explicit where relevant.

### Acceptance

- acceptance criteria are observable;
- criteria trace to legitimate authority or necessary implementation invariants;
- preservation expectations are explicit where material;
- failure behavior is explicit where material.

### Verification

- required evidence is defined;
- verification is proportional to risk;
- known verification limitations are visible;
- Reviewer will have enough evidence to evaluate the result.

### Execution safety

- remaining approval requirements are explicit;
- stop conditions are explicit;
- implementation baseline is immutable or otherwise explicitly constrained;
- exact immutable task revision is resolved before Executor handoff;
- side-effect authorization is explicit;
- Executor is not expected to make product, requirement, architecture, scope, acceptance, or approval decisions.

If a blocking condition remains, do not publish the task as Validated/Published.

---

# Phase 11 — Produce the next valid delivery action

A single invocation MAY review implementation, establish a new accepted baseline, continue planning, and publish the next validated task when no approval or blocking boundary intervenes.

Do not stop merely because one protocol stage completed if the next stage can be advanced safely and within the requested scope.

However, do not cross required human, designated-authority, safety, or side-effect boundaries.

The procedure SHOULD conclude with one of the following outcomes.

If a previously validated task is already waiting for execution, prefer **EXECUTION REQUIRED** rather than publishing dependent successor work.

## Executor Launcher output contract

An **Executor Launcher** is a runtime handoff convenience for a task that is already legitimately published and ready for execution.

It does not create task authority, replace the exact immutable governing task revision, replace the implementation baseline, or weaken any approval, side-effect, capability, or stop-condition boundary.

Emit an Executor Launcher only when the final outcome leaves a published task ready for Executor work.

Execution-ready outcomes are:

- **VALIDATED TASK PUBLISHED**;
- **EXECUTION REQUIRED**;
- **REMEDIATION TASK PUBLISHED**; and
- **IMPLEMENTATION ACCEPTED + NEXT TASK PUBLISHED**, when the successor task is the task ready for execution.

Do not emit an Executor Launcher for:

- **IMPLEMENTATION ACCEPTED** without a successor task;
- **AUTHORITY UPDATE REQUIRED**;
- **APPROVAL REQUIRED**;
- **PLANNING BLOCKED**;
- **SIDE-EFFECT AUTHORIZATION REQUIRED**; or
- **NO DELIVERY ACTION REQUIRED**.

When an Executor Launcher is required:

1. complete all normal outcome reporting first;
2. resolve the actual published task path that is ready for execution;
3. use the filename stem of that task under `.agents/tasks/`;
4. emit the launcher as the final item in the response;
5. emit exactly one fenced `text` code block using the format below;
6. do not place a heading, bullet, label, explanation, or other Markdown immediately before the launcher if it would become part of the launcher itself;
7. do not emit any commentary, explanation, label, Markdown, or other output after the launcher block.

Use exactly this launcher format, replacing `<generated-task-filename>` with the actual published task filename stem without the `.md` extension:

````text
```text
Execute the published repository task:

.agents/tasks/<generated-task-filename>.md

exactly as written with:

TARGET="."
```
````

After emitting the launcher block, output nothing else.

The launcher is a convenience pointer only. Before execution begins, the Executor/runtime MUST still resolve and use the exact immutable governing task revision and implementation baseline required by the canonical contract and published task.

## 1. VALIDATED TASK PUBLISHED

Use when T5 is satisfied for a new coherent objective.

Report:

- task path;
- exact immutable task revision;
- implementation baseline;
- delivery objective;
- key authority references;
- applicable risk notes;
- known non-blocking uncertainties;
- execution or approval boundaries.

The task MAY proceed to Executor automatically unless repository-specific policy requires another approval gate.

When execution is legitimate after this outcome, conclude with the required Executor Launcher for the published task.

## 2. EXECUTION REQUIRED

Use when a valid published task already exists and is awaiting execution or renewed execution.

Report:

- governing task path;
- exact immutable task revision;
- implementation baseline;
- whether this is initial execution or remediation execution;
- required capabilities or known execution boundary;
- any unresolved non-blocking limitation.

Do not create dependent successor implementation work merely because the Planner procedure was invoked again.

Conclude with the required Executor Launcher for the existing published task.

## 3. REMEDIATION TASK PUBLISHED

Use when pending implementation failed review in a bounded way and the same delivery objective remains valid.

Report:

- same stable task path;
- new exact immutable task revision;
- review basis;
- required corrections;
- additional verification;
- unchanged or explicitly updated implementation baseline rules.

Hand back to Executor.

Conclude with the required Executor Launcher for the republished remediation task.

## 4. IMPLEMENTATION ACCEPTED

Use when pending implementation is accepted and no immediate successor task is being published in the same invocation.

Report:

- governing task revision;
- reviewed implementation revision;
- accepted baseline;
- accepted scope;
- verification evidence;
- material non-blocking limitations;
- next planning state when known.

Acceptance does not authorize release.

## 5. IMPLEMENTATION ACCEPTED + NEXT TASK PUBLISHED

Use when:

- implementation is accepted;
- the new accepted baseline is established;
- no approval boundary intervenes;
- the next coherent objective is already justified;
- T5 is satisfied for the successor task.

Report both acceptance evidence and successor-task identity clearly.

The successor task MUST use the new accepted baseline or another explicitly justified immutable baseline.

Conclude with the required Executor Launcher for the published successor task.

## 6. AUTHORITY UPDATE REQUIRED

Use when Business, Product, Requirements, Architecture, Repository Context, Delivery Planning, or another authority-bearing artifact must be created or repaired before executable work is valid.

When authorized to edit those artifacts:

- reuse repository structure;
- make the minimum sufficient update;
- preserve approved decisions;
- maintain traceability;
- mark AI-generated authority-bearing changes Draft when approval is required.

Do not publish an executable task until the applicable authority state permits it.

## 7. APPROVAL REQUIRED

Use when a Draft or changed authority artifact requires designated approval before downstream execution.

Report:

- artifact or decision requiring approval;
- why approval is required;
- affected gate;
- exact condition for resuming.

Do not silently self-approve authority-bearing content.

## 8. PLANNING BLOCKED

Use when safe progress cannot continue because of:

- unresolved authority;
- dependency;
- architecture conflict;
- missing evidence;
- unsafe ambiguity;
- incompatible baseline;
- unavailable required capability;
- another material blocker.

Report:

- earliest blocking gate or review stage;
- exact unresolved issue;
- supporting repository evidence;
- required owner or authority;
- concrete resumption condition.

Do not publish a nominal task merely to keep work moving.

## 9. SIDE-EFFECT AUTHORIZATION REQUIRED

Use when protocol progress requires a side effect that is not already authorized, including creation of an immutable Git revision needed for task publication or baseline acceptance.

Report:

- exact side effect required;
- why it is required;
- affected protocol gate or handoff;
- whether repository policy could authorize it;
- exact condition for resuming.

Do not perform the side effect merely to keep the loop moving.

## 10. NO DELIVERY ACTION REQUIRED

Use when the requested scope is already satisfied and no legitimate remediation, authority update, planning action, or task is required.

Support this conclusion with repository evidence.

# Existing-repository rule

For existing repositories, prefer:

```text
inspect current evidence
→ review pending work
→ establish accepted baseline
→ map evidence to protocol gates
→ reuse what is valid
→ repair only what is missing or unreliable
→ publish the next valid action
```

Do not:

```text
assume greenfield
→ recreate every artifact
→ rewrite repository structure
→ generate documentation for ceremony
→ create a task when no task is justified
```

Conformance is semantic rather than formatting-based.

---

# Remediation rule

Bounded remediation remains part of the same delivery objective.

Use:

```text
same task path
→ task updated
→ new immutable task revision
→ Executor
→ review again
```

Create separate task work when review reveals:

- a materially new objective;
- unrelated defect;
- new feature;
- independent improvement;
- scope expansion;
- new architecture decision;
- new requirement not already governing the objective.

Do not hide new delivery work inside remediation.

---

# Release boundary

Implementation acceptance and accepted-baseline establishment are independent from release.

Do not infer:

```text
ACCEPTED
=
DEPLOYABLE
=
DEPLOYED
=
RELEASED
```

The separate Release Gate remains governed by `.agents/software-workflow.md` and repository-specific release authority.

Release assessment MAY consider, as applicable:

- integration;
- security;
- privacy;
- migrations;
- configuration;
- infrastructure;
- deployment readiness;
- observability;
- rollback;
- operations;
- regulatory obligations;
- external dependencies.

Do not authorize deployment or release unless explicitly permitted by applicable authority.

# Final self-check

Before concluding an invocation, confirm:

- [ ] I loaded the canonical repository contract and delivery protocol.
- [ ] I established the relevant repository state and accepted baseline.
- [ ] I resolved any already-published task or pending Executor result before dependent successor planning.
- [ ] I did not create successor work while a dependent validated task was merely awaiting execution.
- [ ] I identified and reviewed pending implementation before dependent successor planning.
- [ ] I used the exact governing task revision for review.
- [ ] I kept intended authority separate from observed implementation reality.
- [ ] I verified material claims against actual repository evidence.
- [ ] I did not invent business, product, requirement, architecture, scope, acceptance, or approval decisions.
- [ ] I reused valid repository artifacts instead of recreating them unnecessarily.
- [ ] I preserved or repaired progressive bidirectional traceability.
- [ ] I did not invent requirements to justify existing code.
- [ ] I applied repository reuse discipline before proposing new abstractions.
- [ ] I distinguished bounded remediation from materially new work.
- [ ] I recorded R8 closure when remediation findings were actually closed.
- [ ] I established a new accepted baseline only after sufficient review evidence.
- [ ] I did not confuse acceptance with release.
- [ ] I identified the earliest unmet or materially unreliable planning gate.
- [ ] I selected one coherent delivery objective when new task work was justified.
- [ ] I made dependencies, risks, blockers, and approval boundaries explicit.
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are observable and legitimately grounded.
- [ ] Verification requirements are proportional to risk.
- [ ] Stop conditions prevent silent scope expansion.
- [ ] Side-effect authorization is explicit.
- [ ] Any published task has an exact immutable task revision before Executor handoff.
- [ ] If the final outcome leaves a published task ready for execution, I emitted exactly one Executor Launcher as the final response item.
- [ ] The Executor Launcher points to the actual published task path and does not substitute for exact task-revision or baseline resolution.
- [ ] If the final outcome is not execution-ready, I did not emit an Executor Launcher.
- [ ] I did not emit anything after an Executor Launcher.
- [ ] I did not establish A9 from a mutable working-tree state.
- [ ] I published a validated task only when T5 is actually satisfied.
- [ ] I concluded with the next legitimate delivery action rather than forcing task creation.
